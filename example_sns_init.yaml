    In a realm of code, a beacon forth surges,
    a wondrous app on the Internet Computer emerges.
    Born of inspiration divine,
    This marvel of technology briliantly shines.

    With each line of code, a world takes flight,
    A symphony of bits, a chorus of bytes.
    Built on chainkey cryptography, secure and true,
    An app that transcends, all we once knew...
